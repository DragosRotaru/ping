# Adding a new Email Template

- use postmark templates from github
- the head needs to be copied individually to sendgrid (look under the advanced section > edit email head )
- body needs to be copied into an html module
- preheader needs to be removed from body and added to preheader field
- make sure to use Circular font (available on google storage)
- these templates have a media query that enables dark-mode. I've just copied and pasted the contents of said media query to permanently use darkmode
