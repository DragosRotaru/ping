## Getting Started

- Go to the `api` directory and run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies for the api

- Go to the `client` directory and run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies for the client

- Run `npm run start` to run the code in development mode, within either folders.

- Get acquainted with the `package.json` file for both.

- If you would like to install a new dependency, run `npm install PACKAGE_NAME --save` or `npm install PACKAGE_NAME --save-dev` depending on if it is a runtime or development (tooling, compilation, static types, etc) dependency.
