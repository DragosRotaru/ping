Beacons are brands that have a purpose beyond their products — they convert consumers into fans and add value to those fans’ lives, to create culture…not just mirror it. \nOur approach focuses on the intersection of where the Brand’s Values meet the Consumers' Aspirations because this is where the magic lies. Using the right combination of Brains, Beauty, and Bravery — in other words, best-in-class aesthetics, game-changing ideas, and the guts to make it happen — we express brands through the right content, in the right place, at the right time, whether that's in social, broadcast, packaging or experiences.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"Undisclosed","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2002","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"25 Broadway, 2nd Floor","locality":"New York","region":"NY","postal_code":"10004","country":"United States","phone":"212.625.8372"}]}
