We transformed into a company capable of creating a meticulously verified digital roadmap for almost any online retailer by putting together the effort of both parties, utilizing online strategy, email marketing (which is one of our strongest feats), SEO/PPC that actually work, years of experience with best-in-class solutions for Magento and overall ecommerce best practices.\nOn the technical side of things, having developers who have previously released or collaborated on over a 100 bestselling Magento extensions, having successfully been through over 50 mid to large-scale projects and having done every possible Magento integration, the platform no longer holds any secrets for us as we basically know it inside out.\nOur passion for helping retailers grow coupled with incessant and a little naive desire to make a difference make it all a seamless and very pleasant experience for our clients as we know perfectly well how much they care about timely communication and outstanding service quality.\nGo ahead and drop us a line so we can make a difference for you too!\n \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"$25 - $49 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2015","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"8 Skoriny street, office 18","locality":"Minsk","region":"MI","postal_code":"220000","country":"Belarus","phone":"+375 297 245 З45"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"115 W California Boulevard","locality":"Pasadena","region":"CA","postal_code":"91105","country":"United States","phone":"+1 626 239-7-306"}]}
