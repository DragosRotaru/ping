Let's chat? 518-466-4439.\n \nAs a company, we firmly believe in the ideas set forth in The Lean Startup (Eric Ries), Remote (David Heinemeier Hansson) and The Art of the Start (Guy Kawasaki), and are well versed in the themes in successful startups from books such as Founders at Work (Jessica Livingston). We wish to emphasize that software is a means to an end, and its function should be clear in the context of your business.\nTenex Developers is a US-based consulting firm focused on building compelling software solutions. While other firms constrain themselves to a small set of platforms, we believe in choosing the right tool for the job. We develop in a wide array of languages and frameworks, though some of our favorites are Ruby on Rails, Elixir, Angular, Python and Vue.\nWe would love to chat about your next project!\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2016","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"54 Lawrence St","locality":"Medford","region":"MA","postal_code":"02155","country":"United States","phone":"518.466.4439"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"","locality":"Albany","region":"NY","postal_code":"","country":"United States","phone":""}]}
