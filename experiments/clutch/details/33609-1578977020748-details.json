Actually, we only care about one thing, how can you be proud(er) of yourself, or: how do you become an ambassador of your own brand.\n\nYou should be authentic and you shouldn’t be a slave of you clients. Is there something you aren’t proud of? We’re here to help, even if make you dye your hair! We’ll do everything to let people feel the pride at their company again. The energy we use to do this is enormous. Sometimes people see this as confronting, but it is not only about the things we want to create, it’s about the things we have to create to make our clients proud. When we accomplish that we feel proud ourselves too. We’re proud of our clients and partners!\nPeople need to be themselves and should not behave themselves as someone that doesn’t suit them. ‘Just be you, therefore know thyself.’ Take us with you on your trip and please make your life worth living in the meantime!\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2011","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"Wijchenseweg 132","locality":"Nijmegen","region":"","postal_code":"6538","country":"Netherlands","phone":"+31.24.202.21.66"}]}
