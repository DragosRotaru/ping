In truth, Compsoft Creative has a rich history of innovation and creativity and we pride ourselves on keeping at the very the cutting edge of tech.  Some key ‘firsts’;\nWe were the first development house in the UK to officially offer iPhone development (within days of Apple making the SDK available). The same goes for Android and Windows when they quickly followed Apple’s lead.\nWe’ve developed apps to be preinstalled on new Android devices, in particular the first Galaxy Tab for MTV and Samsung (getting our hands on a top secret prototype).\nWe were one of the first to develop for Pebble, Apple Watch and Google Glass.\nWe developed apps which utilised iBeacon technology the year of its release.\nToday you’ll find an enthusiastic team of Developers, Designers, UX specialists and Project Delivery staff working closely together to produce the very best of breed in mobile apps. Collectively our dev team has a broad skillset which covers technologies such as Swift, Objective C, Java, HTML5, .NET, SQL, C++ and so on…\nWe are a team focused on excellence, innovation and we enjoy being challenged. We want to see your app becoming a huge success and will do everything we can to make it one.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"Undisclosed","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"1977","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"7 Oriel Court","locality":"","region":"HAM","postal_code":"GU34 2YT","country":"United Kingdom","phone":"03333 44 23 28"}]}
