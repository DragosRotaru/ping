We are best suited to projects requiring a small, focused development team – an environment where we are uniquely placed to deliver productivity, responsiveness and performance that other providers simply can’t match.\nIt’s difficult to source top experts in the UK at a cost that makes sense for both us and our customers. That’s why we’ve set up our own technical facility in Russia, staffed by top local talent.  In the UK, our consultants and account managers are always on hand to support you. Technical team leads can visit you to initiate a project or work at your premises to configure and support the final product. At the same time, we always encourage our prospective and existing clients to visit our technical facilities in Russia.\nWe are a flexible, customer-friendly firm that wants to add measurable value to your business. But don’t take our word for it. Our client references and level of repeat business prove we can deliver everything that is required and more – even against the most demanding expectations.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"Undisclosed","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"1999","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"","locality":"Saratov Region","region":"","postal_code":"","country":"Russia","phone":""}]}
