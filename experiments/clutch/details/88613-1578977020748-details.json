But then, who isn’t these days? Truth is, we didn’t start the com­pany because we’re better than everyone else; we started it because we’re every bit as good and twice as loyal. Not just to our clients, but to our employees and service providers. Some may perceive loyalty to be a “soft benefit.” We see it as a cultural necessity that delivers bottom-line results.\nAll else being equal, an agency that provides uncommon loyalty to its clients is more likely to help them earn uncommon loyalty from their customers. With that in mind, we make the following promises to each of our clients: \nWe will never have more than 50 employees: Loyalty can only be spread so thin. Our focus is on getting better each day, not bigger. \nOur founders will always be actively engaged in your business: Self-imposed limitations on our size ensure that our founders will be involved on day one and day one thousand. \nWe will never enter awards shows (with one exception): Agencies tend to think the target audience for every project is awards show judges. We’ve yet to see a brief where that was true. The only award we covet is an Effie, which is based on the effectiveness of our work.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$50 - $99 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2010","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"9430 Washington Blvd.","locality":"Culver City","region":"CA","postal_code":"90232","country":"United States","phone":"310.751.6931"}]}
