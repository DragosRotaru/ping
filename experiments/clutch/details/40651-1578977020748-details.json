We have an internal project management process that focuses on clear and consistant communication with our clients. Our engineers are tested so your project will be done right the first time.\nOur company is founded on 3 pillars:\n- Quality\n- Integrity\n- Communication\nQuality\n\nWe will do everything we can to deliver the project as intended. This means using the newest technologies, languages and platforms. We care about security, performance and scalability.Â \nIntegrity\nWe will never disappear or run away from a project. If we tell you the project costs $1,000 but it ends up costing $2,000, we will pay the difference, not you. That is what integrity means to us.\nCommunication\nWe are very simple and direct in how we do business. We try to take the \"business talk\" out of every situation. The idea is to see how we can work together and not over complicate things. We are a team, we are not 1 person, so there's always someone here to help!\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2013","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1412 Broadway","locality":"New York","region":"NY","postal_code":"10018","country":"United States","phone":"646-791-6277"}]}
