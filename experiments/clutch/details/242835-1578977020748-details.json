We are a very 'techie' agency, and we excel in our core business:  website and mobile development.  But, that isn't why our clients choose BlueBolt as their technical partner.\n It is because we take on crucial, difficult tasks other developers don't consider: Project Definition - We act as business analysts, not just technical advisors and consultants.  We follow a rigid process that assures our clients will achieve exactly what is expected.  First, we engage our client for a \"Project Description\", then, we do wireframes and interactive prototypes in our \"User Experience Design\", and lastly, we document all our findings, bring it all together, and offer options tailored to succeed in our \"Functional Specifications\". Enterprise Site Search - We believe that 'Search is the next Killer App', and we have developed an outstanding solution to bring search, filtering, and finding solutions to our web and mobile clients. Web Security, Information Security, and Cyber Security.  Whatever you want to call it, a whole lot of BlueBolt clients need help to assure their online assets and properties are secure.  Most of BlueBolt's peers don't touch this stuff, so we are an ideal partner to marry a development effort to this advanced need.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$50 - $99 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2005","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"216 16th St. Suite 1420,","locality":"Denver","region":"CO","postal_code":"80202","country":"United States","phone":"312.236.4508"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"415 N.
