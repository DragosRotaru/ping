We are made of digital artists, interior designs, stylists, software developers, thinkers, makers and doers.\nWe are purveyors of photorealism and the quality of our images is everything. It is the fundamental core of why we are in business, to try and be the best. In our images, photorealism is the benchmark and we strive daily to compete with reality.\nCreating one photorealistic image is pretty easy with today's thchnology and resources. Repeating this feat over and over again is the difficult bit. To maintain quality with scale, you need access to highly skilled artists and designers, formidably high standards, painstaking attention to detail and a series of systems and processes that we have spent the last 15 years refining. Only then can you deliver consistency on tap.\nDesign underpins everything we do, you can't create great content without it. The internet and apps make design so accessible and ubiquitous that practically everyone is a designer and brands need something special to stand out. Our interior designers, stylists and UI designers are supremely talented at bringing products and spaces to life.\nWe are infatuated with the disruptive technologies flooding the market today, and are always looking for how these can be incorporated into effective solutions for out clients. Our in house development team are always working on something, check out the lab section of our website for more information www.pikcells.com/lab\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2003","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"Wellington Mills, 70 Plover Road","locality":"Huddersfield","region":"WYK","postal_code":"HD3 3HR","country":"United Kingdom","phone":"+44 870 990 5279"}]}
