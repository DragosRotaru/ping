Our Seattle-based team serves small and medium businesses across a wide-range of industries, including legal, biotech, software, e-commerce, and manufacturing. We provide three core benefits for our clients:\nProtect their websites: Keep the website online and free of security concerns. We do this with a combination of automated services (daily backups, uptime monitoring, server malware scans, web traffic firewall) and hands-on work (site hardening, staged testing and implementation of security patches, software updates)\nManage their websites: Implement client requests (such as content updates), monitor the site for SEO or technical concerns, and fix website errors.\nImprove their websites: Regularly suggest and implement improvements to the site’s user experience, with a consistent eye on the client’s goals for its visitors. Every two weeks a Maintaingo developer reviews the website for opportunities, such as improvements to page load speed or finding “dead ends” where visitors often leave the site, then suggest fixes to the client for approval.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2016","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"900 First Ave S, Suite 205 B","locality":"Seattle","region":"WA","postal_code":"98134","country":"United States","phone":"206.429.6060"}]}
