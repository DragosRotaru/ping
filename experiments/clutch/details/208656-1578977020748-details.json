The team that takes the brief is the team that does the work. No hand-offs. No dillydallying. We are intentionally small and we work for flat project fees. Our goal is to create as much as possible with your budget, so we donâ€™t waste time, nor your money. If you are weighing trade-offs between quality, speed and cost, you are looking at the difference between a traditional agency relationship and a Sidecar project.","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2012","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"918 Parker St., #22","locality":"Berkeley","region":"CA","postal_code":"94710","country":"United States","phone":"510.400.7293"}]}
