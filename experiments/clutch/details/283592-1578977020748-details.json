Now one of the leading technology companies in Eastern Europe, we started out in 2000 as a privately-owned-and-managed business. Our foresight and ongoing desire to evolve have continuously attracted partners and talent of equally bold vision throughout the past 16 years. This enabled us to mature and diversify our expertise, without compromising any of our innovation-inducing enthusiasm.\n\nWe believe in finding the project-specific best solution, by encouraging transparency and building trust. Latest technology, our active investment in our people, worldwide-compliant Agile methodologies, emerging and established programming languages, and the uniquely-creative-InCrys-touch are some of the main assets we involve in delivering state-of-the-art Software Solutions.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$25 - $49 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2000","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"4A, Timisoara Blvd, AFI Park 5 wing of AFI 4&5 office building","locality":"Bucharest","region":"","postal_code":"061328","country":"Romania","phone":"+4021 344 34 10"}]}
