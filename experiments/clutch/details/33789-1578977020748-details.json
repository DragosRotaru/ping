Established in 2007, Bluecadet collaborates with leading museums, cultural institutions, universities, and nonprofit organizations to educate, engage, and entertain. From a touchscreen T.\nRex puzzle at Chicago’s Field Museum, to a multimedia advocacy campaign for Doctors Without Borders, to MoMA’s bilingual mobile guide exploring the murals of Diego Rivera, our work inspires interaction and imagination. \nThe Bluecadet team includes strategists, designers, and developers working alongside illustrators, animators, and photographers in our 8,400-square-foot office and production headquarters in Philadelphia’s Fishtown neighborhood. We are proud to have created custom digital experiences for over 20 distinguished institutions in our hometown including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, The Franklin Institute, and the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to an Emmy, our work has earned several Webby, Webvisionary, ADDY, SXSW, and AAM Muse awards, among other honors.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2005","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1526 Frankford Ave","locality":"Philadephia","region":"PA","postal_code":"19125","country":"United States","phone":"267.639.9956"}]}
