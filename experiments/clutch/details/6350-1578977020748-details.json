Building brand awareness, increasing sales and growing businesses just comes with the territory. We've helped businesses of all shapes and sizes, so, what we can do for you?\nIn work as in life, you get the best results when you keep it simple. So we started Westwerk Design by subtracting everything that complicates and compromises the business: overcrowded meetings, jargon-infused gibberish, egos in constant need of stroking, needless layers of meddling, muddling management, and the words “good enough.” In fact, we got rid of everything except super-smart and talented people, an unflagging passion for inspiring design, and a bedrock-deep belief that the greatest work is work that sells.\nThat’s how we created an agency we love enough to call home, and that our clients love enough to trust with their business and recommend to their friends. It’s also a blueprint for the way we’ll work with you.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2005","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1621 E Hennepin Ave #B6","locality":"Minneapolis","region":"MN","postal_code":"55414","country":"United States","phone":"612.353.5349"}]}
