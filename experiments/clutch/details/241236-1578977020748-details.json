This is an offer that you would be silly to pass up. There's a catch though, it's only for established businesses and it's only for those that understand the difference a powerful SEO campaign can make to your bottom line.\nI charge plenty for my time but if you're a business owner running an established business and if you can spare 45 minutes of your valuable time I will tell you what issues your website is facing and give you a plan for getting your site ranked at the top of the SERPS. This consultation is completely free. I will analyze your website on the fly and tell you what potential issues or battles we will face while optimizing your site. I'll explain the veteran SEO strategy I will use to get your business ranked at the top of the SERPS and will let you know exactly what's holding your website back. After we're done there we can even discuss return on investment. It's one of my sticking points for my clients, the ability must exist for you to get a solid ROI. Let me state this again because this will be an important aspect of our call, if I can't get you a great return then I will not take on your campaign.Â \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$50 - $99 / hr","num_employees":"Freelancer","founded":"Undisclosed","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"100 Fillmore Street 5th Floor,","locality":"Denver","region":"CO","postal_code":"80206","country":"United States","phone":"+1.303.997.2222"}]}
