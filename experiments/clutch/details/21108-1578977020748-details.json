If so, you've come to the right place.\nFounded in January 2007, we work with business owners and marketing executives that want more from their business-to-business (B2B) marketing efforts, and want to work with a partner that can help you overcome obstacles and capture new opportunities in thought leadership and lead generation.\n \nThe first step to accelerating your sales growth is our B2B Marketing Audit, which identifies problems to be fixed, gaps to be filled, and opportunities to be seized.\nRecommendations from the audit form the basis of your customized B2B Ignite Program. B2B Ignite typically pays for itself in the first 9-18 months, with an ROI over 300% in the first 2-3 years.\n \nB2B Ignite covers all Four Ps of Marketing that drive the Fifth P: Profit. Other marketing agencies only focus on marketing communications, while we also support your product management, channel marketing, and value-based pricing efforts.\n \nOur clients see value in taking a strategic and holistic B2B marketing approach, understand that marketing results come from an open and collaborative effort, and value Innovaxis being a strategic partner instead of a vendor.\nGet started here: https://www.innovaxisinc.com/marketing-strategy-b2b/marketing-audit\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$200 - $300 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2007","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"3047 N.
