We develop strategic work focused on building our clients' businesses through smart design. We built YYES on the premise that smart design is best accomplished by a small, hard-working group of designers equipped with apt resources and in close collaboration with clients. We added a Minneapolis office in 2008 to leverage the cityâ€™s access to clients on both coasts as well as its design community.","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2000","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"3460 Ocean View Blvd, Suite D","locality":"Glendale","region":"CA","postal_code":"91208","country":"United States","phone":"+1.818.369.7990"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"1624 Harmon Place, Suite 205","locality":"Minneapolis","region":"MN","postal_code":"55403","country":"United States","phone":"+1.612.605.4875"}]}
