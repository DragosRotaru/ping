After working together at the record label for twelve years as GM and Creative Director, respectively, Steve Balcom and Lane Wurster decided to get into a more honest line of work — advertising.\nOur idea was to take what we had learned about branding and marketing music products and offer it to businesses and organizations that were interested in a more creative marketing approach. Seventeen years on, The Splinter Group has stayed true to its mission and has earned a reputation as one of the most agile, creative shops around. We tell compelling stories about things we believe in, whether it be a retailer, a restaurant, a brewery, a technology company or a band. We seek to capture the essence of our client’s work (both what they do and how they uniquely do it) and turn that into an easily-understood narrative. The story generally begins with a visual identity and is then conveyed via a variety of modes, generally dependent on budget. While we see ourselves as brand developers, The Splinter Group is a full service agency.  Each and every day you will find us designing collateral, developing websites, planning media, devising PR campaigns, creating social media and loyalty platforms and doing just about anything else our clients need or want.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2000","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"605 West Main Street #201","locality":"Carrboro","region":"NC","postal_code":"27510","country":"United States","phone":"919.969.0979"}]}
