In this age of identity, the possibilities are truly endless. Brands have the opportunity to connect with their audience from the moment they wake up to when they go to bed. The challenge is then, how do you make these connections both meaningful and consistent.\nThe answer we believe is through the application of rigorous design-led thinking which creates rich, coherent and adaptive brand identity systems. We’re specialists in this and our approach is to work as Brand Identity Partners. Meaning we work with our clients as partners, from the outset. Creating strong foundations for strategic creativity – delivering identities that stand the test of time in a landscape that’s always changing. This core belief of partnership has stood us in good stead. Allowing us to forge strong and lasting relationships with clients ranging from energetic entrepreneurs to market-leading global brands. And we’re incredibly proud to say our founding partnership is as strong today as it was 17 years ago when we first opened our doors.\n \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2001","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"25 The Village, 101 Amies Street","locality":"London","region":"LND","postal_code":"SW11 2JW","country":"United Kingdom","phone":"+44.20.7924.4533"}]}
