Because our focus is on Main street and local businesses, it is important that our team is available to you when you have questions, ideas, or the need for a new feature on your site.\nOutsourcing from the United States has become somewhat of an accepted practice, which lowers costs but also lessens control of the product, quality of the code, and ability for questions to be answered when you have them.
