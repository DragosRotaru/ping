We know how to launch a startup with minimal investment, get satisfied users, start sales and find investors. \nDevelopment Price. How to Reduce It?\nWe use the “Lean production” method to save the project budget. It is also referred to as “lean manufacturing”, “bootstrapping” (tightening belts) is another close term. The sense of the method is in cutting the functionality that is not of a high value for the end-user. In other words, during each new sprint, we add only those functions, without which the application really cannot be launched. This can be compared with a visit to the IKEA shop. You can always buy there everything you need, even if you have a modest budget.\nScrum & Agile\nWe are working on the Scrum flexible development methodology. The development plan consists of the complete short iterations – sprints. The duration of each sprint equals to 6 weeks. As a result of each sprint, we get fully tested and ready to work mobile applications. Thus, the customer gets the most rapid return on their investments and feedback from his users. This enables you to flexibly restructure the development plan in accordance with the wishes of the end user of the application, as these wishes can be very different from the original view of our client.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$25 - $49 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2010","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"7190 W Sunset Blvd #31C","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","postal_code":"90046","country":"United States","phone":"+1 (323) 329 4343"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"Nizhegorodskaya, 32 b.16","locality":"Moscow","region":"","postal_code":"109029","country":"Russia","phone":"+7 495 108 7484"}]}
