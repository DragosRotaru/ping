In the business software market today, most vendors still use the mass-production, one-size-fits-all approach that Henry Ford pioneered over 100 years ago.\nAt Xeo, we use proven processes that allow us rapidly build completely custom solutions from scratch while using principles that made assembly-line manufacturing so productive. The end result is enterprise software that is perfectly molded to each client’s business.\nCustom software functions range from improving business processes and streamlining manufacturing to increasing workforce communication and efficiency. These web applications are then hosted on a robust and secure hardware platform where employees, customers, and vendors can all access a fully integrated suite of customized portals. Your business is unique. Your software should be too.\nAt Xeo, it’s not about us, but about you. It’s software. Your way.\nWe love what we do and it shows! Our enthusiasm is reflected in our top rated customer service and the quality and thoughtfulness of our engineering.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"Undisclosed","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2001","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"7119 Bethencourt","locality":"San Antonio","region":"TX","postal_code":"78209","country":"United States","phone":"800.910.7871"}]}
