To this end we have created a multi-platform orientated pipeline where we can take elements created for animation and stills and use them in immersive Virtual and Augmented Reality applications. We are a fully inclusive employer and work with people of all backgrounds, genders, races, and disabilities.\nOur diverse team is drawn from many ages and different walks of life and is reflected in the range of our work. Community interaction is part of our heritage, we are on the board of the Manimation animation conference, speak at conferences and student events/universities, and take an active part in creative & tech community events in Greater Manchester, including Gameopolis, VRMCR, Northern Soho, and more. We’re proud supporters of the Northern Powerhouse project and a leading member of the PACT trade organisation. We often represent the UK on official government trade missions all around the world such as China, San Francisco, MIPCOM in Cannes etc and often write about it on our blog.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"1996","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"Fairbairn Building, 70–72 Sackville Street","locality":"Manchester","region":"GTM","postal_code":"M1 3NJ","country":"United Kingdom","phone":"+44.0161.235.8505"}]}
