Our main expertise is Sylius - an eCommerce framework based on Symfony. BitBag is the leading Sylius vendor partner and has a lot of experience in delivering clean, stable & scalable projects on top of it.\nWe are huge fans of writing clean and reliable code. We deliver using BDD, DDD & Event Storming methodologies whenever we need them. We do our best to choose the right tools for the right job - that is why we always try to understand the business before we get our hands dirty so that our client gets the best match for his needs.\nAt BitBag we also love open source. We are the authors of the most commonly used Sylius open source packages like the content management system, PSP integrations, marketing automation tools and many more.\nFor more complex projects, we fulfill our eCommerce stack with eZ Platform for content management, Pimcore/Akeneo for Product Information & Data Assets Management and the Symfony framework itself - for more complex microservices. We are also in love with PWA. For this purpose, we use VueStorefront - an open source store skeleton compatible with Progressive Web App standards built upon Vue.js.\nWe work with clients from all over Europe, especially from DACH countries. Most of BitBag's developers speak English and/or German. Every project manager at BitBag is a native English speaker, in most cases - both English & German.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$50 - $99 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2017","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"Kołątaja 5 Oficyna 4","locality":"Opole","region":"OP","postal_code":"46-043","country":"Poland","phone":"(+48) 797954681"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"Ostóżki 2/3","locality":"Białe Błota (Bydgoszcz)","region":"KP","postal_code":"86-005","country":"Poland","phone":"(+48) 725 035 689"}]}
