Over the next 20 years, we helped global brands reimagine digital and transform their businesses through strategic consulting, innovative creative ideas, and cutting-edge technology thinking.\n \nToday, we are 950 employees across 11 global offices. Even though we’re much bigger than when we started out in Calgary, we remain true to our roots—we’re transparent, honest, passionate, and have a can-do attitude that our clients notice and appreciate. Our executive and global leadership team use an open and accessible management style to drive our success on all fronts: innovating our services, mentoring our talent, and ensuring we deliver industry-leading work. We believe this is core to our success as a digital leader.\n \nWe are now majority-owned (99%) by Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE: OMC). Omnicom is one of the largest holding companies for global advertising, marketing, digital and communications services firms. Their global revenue is over $15 billion, and they have more than 5,000 clients in over 100 countries.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"Undisclosed","num_employees":"250 - 999","founded":"1996","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1011 9th Avenue SE, Suite 300","locality":"Calgary","region":"AB","postal_code":"T2G 0H7","country":"Canada","phone":"+1 403 262 3006"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"Bankside 2, 100 Southwark Street,","locality":"London","region":"","postal_code":"SE1 0SW","country":"United Kingdom","phone":"+44 (0) 208 618 1750"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"200 Varick Street, Suite 610","locality":"New York","region":"NY","postal_code":"10014","country":"United States","phone":"+1 917 606 8000"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"225 N.
