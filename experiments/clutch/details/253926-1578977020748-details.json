There are times when marketing is specific to your literal DNA based on your race or ethnicity and there are times where your race or ethnicity is a part of your Cultural DNA™. This is our proprietary tool which allows us to analyze heritage and culture in identifying the appropriate cultural insights that form the strategic foundation upon which our campaigns are built. One's Cultural DNA™ is so much richer than just one’s race or ethnicity. It's about all of your heritage as well as your cultural influences, which are woven together to create the soul of what makes you…you.\nAnd today, we're focused on the next 43 years. Senior Management has invested in some of the best and brightest marketing and advertising professionals to create management and creative teams poised to lead UWG to continue its heritage of innovation. The charge for the new guard is not simply to create advertising campaigns, but to build unique environments that tap into the cultural insights and heritage that make consumers who they are, that surround and engage them intellectually and emotionally, and that exist at the intersection of their desires and their needs.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"1969","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1 MetroTech Center North, 11th flr.
