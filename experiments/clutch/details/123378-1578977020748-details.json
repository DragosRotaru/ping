The highly competitive market doesn’t allow us to be anything else. And if we weren’t, we wouldn’t have been building software products for over 15 years.\n \nWe used to \"Harness Chaos\" – to strike at the heart of a problem until a solution revealed itself. It took us half a decade to learn that creating a software solution is only half the battle. The other half is ensuring our clients have a good, restful sleep the night before a major milestone is delivered. Serenity is the consequence of harnessed chaos. And our promise to you.\n \nOur process, your stability\nBuild your product following a clear and rigorous process. From idea to sketch, and from sketch to masterpiece, we’ll be right next to you. Discover - Plan - Develop - Test - Manage - Maintain. These are the steps we've always followed; however, they have been improved year after year, client after client. And there’s been quite a few – we learned from and befriended over 200+ clients, most of whom are still with us.\n \nSolution Discovery and Business Analysis\nOur discovery process has been refined from both ends: the agency's view AND the client's. As such, we are better positioned to understand how the product we must build integrates into your business flow (and business plan), but also in your customers' lives.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$50 - $99 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2009","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"Alexander von Humboldt nr 18","locality":"Bucharest","region":"","postal_code":"","country":"Romania","phone":"0040730694193"}]}
