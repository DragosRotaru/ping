We provide a one-stop solution for web and app development, tailor-made according to your taste.\n \nHere’s an overview of what we have been striving for, since the past 4 years-\n1. Producing over a 100 happy clients across continents (literally, except Antarctica).\n2. Undertaking around 150 projects using cutting edge technologies.\n3. Building a team that is bonded by the love of coding and coffee.\n4. Cementing our name in today’s IT scenario through tireless efforts and smart decision making.\n \nHow we get you where you want to be:\nAs soon as you knock on our door we engage a set of consultants to make a vague idea, concrete and a good idea, great. From here we pass it to the planners, who build around it and give a framework for the designers to work on. This structured idea is now handed over to the developers who work their binary magic and challenge it to the testers. After a series of checking and correcting we get a refined product which is then deployed off. This product undergoes stringent scrutiny and deliberation before being polished for launch.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"< $25 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2013","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"701, The Affaires, Sector 17, Sanpada","locality":"Navi Mumbai","region":"MH","postal_code":"400705","country":"India","phone":""}]}
