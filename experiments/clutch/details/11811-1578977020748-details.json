We provide the full service, from scoping and specification through interface and interactivity design, programming and testing to final production and publication to the appropriate app stores.\n\nWe often integrate these apps with back end data services and create web sites or presence to accompany the apps we build. We also build apps that are not destined for release via the public app stores, usually to assist business and enterprises in using mobile as a platform for their own technology needs.\nWe have a number of apps live in the iTunes app store: Search for Bluemungus Limited in iTunes to see some of our current releases.\nAt Bluemungus we love what we do and we believe in forging close working relationships with our clients.
