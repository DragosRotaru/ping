Following my graduation from the University of Cumbria in 2008 I began my freelance design career as Sam Ferguson Design. Since then I have worked with many businesses, helping them to build their brand and develop a strong web presence. I specialize in helping small businesses become local household names.","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"Freelancer","founded":"2008","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"18 Scotby Close","locality":"Carlisle, Cumbria","region":"","postal_code":"CA1 2XG","country":"United Kingdom","phone":"784.184.3390"}]}
