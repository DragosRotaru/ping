Of the clients we had five years ago, more than 95% are still active clients today.\n \nSince our founding in 2004, our people have been our greatest asset. By supporting the passions of our team and investing heavily in leadership and professional development, we have enjoyed a profound employee retention rate—in fact, no employee has ever chosen to leave Digital Deployment to work somewhere else.

We have been named the #1 Best Place to Work and Healthiest Employer by the Sacramento Business Journal.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$50,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2004","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"2321 P Street","locality":"Sacramento","region":"CA","postal_code":"95816","country":"United States","phone":"916 238 1800"}]}
