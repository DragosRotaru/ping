The same goes for lunch and dinner. With over 13 years of experience and more than 500 people, we’ve helped dozens of enterprises achieve their digital goals. Either by starting early in the digitization phase or by getting involved later on in the growth stage, we become an integral part of our clients’ business.\n \nAs end to end software development providers, we cover various industries while maintaining a consistent approach to deliver top notch solutions. We work successfully with our clients either by incubating teams and covering everything from top to bottom or by augmenting their own team and acting as an extension of their business, helping them scale with a bit more firepower. This brought us long term relationships with clients and companies from all over the world, mainly from the United States and Europe.\nNo matter the business model, our policy is to build products and support businesses, not just provide lines of code. That means that besides our army of software developers we also employ business analysts, product managers, UX designers, manual and automation QA testers, offering a full range of services. In the end, we’re more than providers or developers.\nWe’re your partner in building the right solution for your business. We’re there when you need us.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$50,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$25 - $49 / hr","num_employees":"250 - 999","founded":"2005","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"62 Motilor Street","locality":"Transylvania","region":"CJ","postal_code":"400370","country":"Romania","phone":"+ 40 364 101204"}]}
