Even if you need 30 developers, everyone working on your project is split into small agile teams of 2-6 devs.\n \nWe follow an agile process – We follow the Scrum method of software development. It’s a fast and iterative process. Your project will be broken into short development cycles (called “sprints”). Working closely with you, we monitor progress daily and at the end of each sprint you have new workable software.\nWe write code to test your code – To ensure quality code, we create automated tests that are written alongside your software. This checks your code is doing what it’s supposed to be doing, and ensures bugs are spotted quickly and automatically.\nWe pair developers for efficiency – With two developers working on problems you can build better code faster. We pair our developers around half the time for normal tasks. But when things get tricky, two developers work together 100% of the time in order solve the most complex problems.\nWe’re constantly shipping code – What that means is we operate on very short development cycles. You don’t have to wait 6 months to see your working software. We’re publishing features daily and weekly, so you see software developing quickly in front of your eyes.\nNeed a rock-solid development team to help you get your project to the finished line?\nFrom helping entrepreneurs build their idea, to helping national companies become more efficient, we can handle any technical challenge thrown at us.\n \n \n \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$25,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2014","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"339E 3900S","locality":"Salt Lake City","region":"UT","postal_code":"84129","country":"United States","phone":"801 656 0470"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"","locality":"Brasília","region":"","postal_code":"04534-040","country":"Brazil","phone":""}]}
