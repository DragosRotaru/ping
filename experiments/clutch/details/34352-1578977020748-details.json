Instead of focusing solely on what service to sell our clients, we focus on the lifecycle a guest goes through when selecting their travel. We know that for a great majority of business and leisure travelers, their selection process happens online. The process starts with a potential guest building a list of potential hotels and follows a long path to their ultimate selection.\nMost Digital Marketing Firms only focus on the bottom of the funnel, allowing them to report shallow advertising returns while their client’s market shares dwindle. At GCommerce, we use a combination of world-class management tools and fundamentally sound marketing practices to influence consumers at all stages of their journey. Our services are designed to deliver a complete digital marketing presence and help our clients gain market share.\n \nGCommerce offers Website Design, Digital Advertising, Search Marketing and Social Media Advertising to our diverse group of some of the best hotels, resorts and casinos in the world.  \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2002","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1912 Sidewinder Drive","locality":"Park City","region":"UT","postal_code":"84060","country":"United States","phone":""}]}
