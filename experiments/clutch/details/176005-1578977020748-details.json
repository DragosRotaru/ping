From our first day, we’ve been guided by a “People First” approach to our work, our culture, and our client partnerships. Here’s what that means: We create ideas and experiences that resonate with people. Things people want to share, talk about and engage with.\nWe start by seeing a brand’s business challenges through the “People Lens,” a fancy way of saying that we place ourselves in the lives of the people on the other end of an experience or piece of brand communication. We hold our work to a higher standard than any industry award: the human standard. And we do that work within a culture that empowers people to learn and grow in their careers and their lives.
