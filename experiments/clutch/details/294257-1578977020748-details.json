Originally founded in a London bedroom in 2007, Superfried is now based in the centre of Manchester. Specialising in brand identity and experimental typography, I design bespoke print and digital solutions across all sectors. My clients are equally varied in both scale and location, from start-ups in Russia to global brands in New York, LA, London and Cape Town.\n\nWhen required I collaborate with trusted specialists to ensure client expectations, analogue or digital, are met and surpassed. This enables Superfried to efficiently deliver complex projects usually expected of much larger studios.\n\nThe eclectic, award winning work has been recognised and featured globally both in print and online. Continual experimentation with letterforms has also led to the commercial release of 15 display typefaces to date.\n\nTo discuss how I can help you with your project please drop me a mail at mark@superfried.com briefly outlining your requirements. I will promptly reply to arrange a chat over tea or wifi.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2007","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"Canada House .
