We provide both product and strategy consulting, in addition to technical implementation and project execution. We believe in an independent approach to technology solutions and work with firms to define, deliver and execute their technology strategy.\nAccordingly, we perform vendor analysis and technical development based on industry best practices. When an off-the-shelf solution does not meet the needs of our partners, custom application development is necessary to bridge the gap between best-in-breed (specialized) and ERP solutions (general).\n​\nTTG prides itself on our ability to solve complex business problems with custom-tailored solutions that support the ever-changing business environment of our partners. We focus on business value first, aligning the strategy and direction of our partners with their specific technical needs, before providing a technology roadmap to implement the mutually established vision. By working closely with our partners and obtaining feedback along the way, we guarantee a positive experience that yields fruitful results.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"Undisclosed","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2014","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"300 Bedford Street","locality":"Manchester","region":"NH","postal_code":"03101","country":"United States","phone":""}]}
