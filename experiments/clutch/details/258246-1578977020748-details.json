We work in both digital and physical disciplines, though our projects find all kinds of ways to dissolve the boundaries between the two.

We want to get them talking about something amazing they’ve experienced—not about an advertising campaign.","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2006","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"2124 Penn Ave. Fl 5","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"PA","postal_code":"15222","country":"United States","phone":"412.362.0201"}]}
