We've consistently stayed on the forefront of app technology and trends over the past decade, being one of a handful of iOS app developers with a presence on the iTunes App Store since Day 1; we were early adopters of the Android ecosystem as well. \nCrossComm is more than a software development studio - while we can write code very well, we see ourselves as consultants,“Digital Sherpas” who seek to profoundly understand our clients' motivations and help interpret those motivations into design and technical requirements. In designing and building apps, countless micro-decisions and compromises need to be made along the way and we aim to make every one of them with our client's business interests in mind. We are not \"yes people\" and we do not hesitate in offering differing perspectives or recommendations, or discarding ideas if better ones emerge. In short, we strive to see ourselves as part of your team.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$25,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"1998","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"201 West Main Street Suite 208","locality":"Durham","region":"NC","postal_code":"27701","country":"United States","phone":""}]}
