We start with user research and it sits at the center of our process, we’ll talk with users to create foundational artifacts like detailed persons, experience maps, service blueprints, jobs to be done documents that then influence wire-frames and prototypes we can use for testing our assumptions.  During our UX process we’ll work on design exploration activities for the digital UI by creating style tiles and mood boards which inform the product or websites visual interaction. Once we’re finished it all comes together to delight your users and make your business more successful.\n \nWhat we do -\n \nProduct Strategy - https://www.freshtilledsoil.com/what-we-do/product-strategy/\nDesign Sprint Facilitation - https://www.freshtilledsoil.com/what-we-do/design-sprint-facilitation/\nUser Experience Design - https://www.freshtilledsoil.com/what-we-do/user-experience-design/\nUser Interface Design + UI Kits - https://www.freshtilledsoil.com/what-we-do/user-interface-design-3/\nDesign Strategy - https://www.freshtilledsoil.com/what-we-do/design-strategy-3/\nRapid Prototypes (Click to see example) - https://invis.io/YDGCAO73KG2\nProduct and Design Resources - https://www.freshtilledsoil.com/resources/\n \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2005","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"43 Broad St, Suite C300","locality":"Hudson","region":"MA","postal_code":"01749","country":"United States","phone":"862.221.1805"}]}
