User testing and feedback is an integral part of our process. The user will have their say one way or another. We think it should be as early as possible.\nAnything can be improved\nWe are always uncovering new ways to make things better. The biggest impact can often come from the cumulative effect of many small details.\nWe are in the service business\nOur success is a direct result of the partnerships we form with our clients and the results we achieve together. We earn our next project by how well we did on the previous one.\nOur clients tell us there are three key reasons they choose to work with Fell Swoop:\nArt & Science\nWe pair our research and data-based mindset with a keen sense of the possible to provide a unique creative point of view.\nSpeed & Flexibility\nWe understand the realities of tight go-to-market timeframes and embrace the challenge of big, hairy, audacious goals. We work the way our clients need us to work. It’s that simple.\nCollaboration at the Core\nWe strive with our clients for the results neither of us would be able to achieve without the other. We need partnership to make our work successful. We believe the feeling is mutual.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2008","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1924 1st Ave, Suite 300","locality":"Seattle","region":"WA","postal_code":"98101","country":"United States","phone":"206.494.3347"}]}
