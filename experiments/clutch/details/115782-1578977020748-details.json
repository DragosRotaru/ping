We’re a people company focused on client relationships. Oh, and we build really great websites.\nStarting as a collaboration between two brothers in 2005, Box Clever has since expanded both its systems and services to provide you with exactly what you need - easy to use websites you can love. We built our own content management system, WebGuide, to enable our clients to manage their own content on their own time. It’s so easy to use that grade one students were able to publish to the web for Alberta’s Centennial without any training (it’s a great story, ask us about it sometime). We take that functionality and make it beautiful with the help of our talented team of designers who are well versed in user-centered design.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2005","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"5347 75 Street NW","locality":"Edmonton","region":"AB","postal_code":"T6E 0W4","country":"Canada","phone":"780.485.1230"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"#200 100 Palisades Way,","locality":"Sherwood Park","region":"","postal_code":"T8H 0T1","country":"Canada","phone":"780.485.1230"}]}
