We do marketing, advertising and branding. We have more passion for this business and our  clients than you’ll find anywhere. We love what we do because the rewards, the relationships and the results are so fulfilling. The backbone of our agency is our ability to design and produce a creative product for all facets of media: print, broadcast, outdoor, point-of-purchase, web design, collateral, public relations and promotions.\nWe go beyond the traditional – we help clients develop identities that customers will respond to and remember. All creative and media are handled in-house by our full-time staff. We’re a close knit-group who firmly believes a smaller, dedicated staff is more functional — and offers a much quicker reaction time. We don't suffer from the large agency syndrome where the left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing.  We all work with the knowledge of each piece of business that comes in and goes out. After 40 years, we can truly say we’ve done it all, and done it well. And our trophy case proves this. We have won hundreds of major awards for excellence in advertising. Our experience and success has enabled us to be selective about the company we keep.  We’ve purposely kept our client list short so that we can give each of our clients the attention we believe they deserve.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"1977","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1055 St. Charles Ave., Suite 201,","locality":"New Orleans","region":"LA","postal_code":"70130","country":"United States","phone":"504.581.7500"}]}
