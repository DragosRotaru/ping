We've been in business since 2009.\nWe operate like a traditional development agency in that we create websites and applications for an evolving set of clients. But we also provide on-demand tech team services for clients who retain us for months and years. We, in fact, recently entered our fifth year with our oldest client. We love the relationships and working environment that these long-term relationships give us.\nBetween taking on fresh projects with new clients and forming working relationships with our contract partners, we think we get the best of both worlds: new, exciting work combined with stable, goal-oriented ventures.\nAt Blueshoon, we love to problem solve, we value efficiency and hard work, and we believe that our work space should be fun, productive, and open.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2008","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"5215 N.
