It got less and less effective, and I knew there had to be a better way.”\nInertia was founded after over 15 years in corporate marketing and advertising. Our goal is to partner with the best businesses we can find. We want to find companies with great stories and an inspiring mission, and work together to help turn more consumers into customers and brand advocates. \nOur core focus is transforming recruiting and marketing for healthcare brands. Through the use of carefully crafted acquisition funnels, we have been able to drastically decrease cost-per-lead while increasing lead flow.\nAt Inertia, we don’t have clients. We have partners. Our success is built on rolling up our sleeves and working side by side with our partners, from the drawing board to the boardroom. \nOur services include: Search Engine Optimization, Email Marketing, Search Engine Marketing, Social Media Management, Digital Reputation Management, Website Development, and more.
