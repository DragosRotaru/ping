What I didn’t fully understand was the difference between a website and a really good website. For our newest business we had very high website design expectations based on our previous website efforts with the first business. We were referred to Murmur by a longtime friend and we knew after the first meeting with them that we would not be disappointed. Not only did they design our perfect company logo but they created for us the most beautiful website we could have imagined. Perfect in design and style for our business with content that is easy to access and manage, I am still so thrilled whenever I open up our home page. It was easily the best investment we made and now I’m currently working with them to redesign our first business’ website.”\n~Matthew Busetto Owner/ Firehouse Restaurant\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2007","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1300 SE Stark St #210","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97214","country":"United States","phone":"971.254.8662"}]}
