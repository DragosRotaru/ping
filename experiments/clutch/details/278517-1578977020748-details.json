We can aid with identifying these areas and putting solutions in place to deliver it in a more timely and efficient manner, freeing staff to work in areas more beneficial to the company. The IIA carry out internal audits and also assist on preventing fraud. Another less well known area of their work is to assist companies in promoting best practice.
