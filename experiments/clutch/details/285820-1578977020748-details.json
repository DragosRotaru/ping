On the other hand, you might not be a computer person at all. Either way, we know you’ll enjoy working with us at Webcentric Solutions, because we’ll give you as much information as you need — and we’ll explain it in a way you understand.\nOne thing you ought to know is that we’re completely independent and totally ‘vendor neutral’ — in other words, we don’t have any affiliation to software companies. We don’t make any profits from promoting or selling specific applications. Our only interest in recommending something to you is that we believe it’s the best and most productive option for your business. Another aspect of working with Webcentric is that you won’t encounter what can happen with some other agencies – the sort whose directors meet with you initially, but when you’ve signed a contract hand your account to a junior member of staff. Each person at Webcentric who touches your project has at least five years specialist experience in their field. We’re not ones to brag, but it’s a fact that one of our clients went from nothing to a £100,000 turnover in their first 12 months of operating — and they put it down to how Webcentric delivered their online marketing.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2008","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"432 Bearwood Road","locality":"Birmingham","region":"WMD","postal_code":"B66 4EY","country":"United Kingdom","phone":"+44.800.014.8320"}]}
