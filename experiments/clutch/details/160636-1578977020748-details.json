However, one of the biggest challenges with large scale companies is their complex structure, which requires super-eminent coordination between different offshore teams. Medium and small scale enterprises, on the other hand, usually end up working on conceptual understandings instead of focusing on spec sheets as large companies do.\n \nMoreover, the app development market is currently leaving time-honoured apps behind and adapting new purpose-oriented apps.  As a result, the requirements of e-scooter app development and taxi booking app development have heaved into view from out of nowhere. \n \nCoruscate Solutions Pvt Ltd was established to address these challenges. We are a desktop, web, and mobile app development company that exists to bring about a sense of compatibility between the complex structures of large scale companies and the needs of medium and small scale enterprises. Founded by four friends right after graduation, Coruscate Solutions is a fully bootstrapped company that has grown from having only its four founders in a single room at the start to more than 200 members working in a state-of-the-art development facility. \n \nWe work with the latest, cutting- edge technologies in application development including taxi app development and e-scooter app development to envision software that innovate, ease and streamline traditional and modern business processes. Driven by a young team at the helm, we have built up an enviable list of satisfied clients, who now ensure that a lion’s share of our business growth is through word-of-mouth publicity.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$25 - $49 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2013","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"103, Mangaldeep-2","locality":"Surat","region":"GJ","postal_code":"395006","country":"India","phone":"(0261)-255-5553"}]}
