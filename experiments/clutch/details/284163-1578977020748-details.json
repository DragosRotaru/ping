For more than 25 years, we’ve collaborated with many notable organizations to develop and establish brand and marketing strategies to help bring their stories to life. At Paragraph, “branding” is not an ancillary service and is more than a logo, stationery package, website, or advertisement.\nBranding is a strategic asset that defines your difference, creates consistency, and communicates the value that is required to form and maintain long-term relationships with your constituents. As a creative agency, we marry strategic words and images to create compelling and concise messages that help our clients manage their investment and achieve their goals. Utilizing our BrandBond® methodology, our agency partners with our clients to help them articulate their brand’s promise, differentiator, and value proposition to meet their business objectives. We work in different sectors and industries to cross-pollinate ideas and best practices to the benefits of our clients. Our creative mantra — Be Simple. Be Clear. Be Good. — drives everything we do.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"1991","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1429 Walnut St., Suite 501","locality":"Philadelphia","region":"PA","postal_code":"19102","country":"United States","phone":"215.629.3550"}]}
