We build mobile apps that capture the excitement, shared community, brand and conversation around your event. Whether it's for a music festival, sporting event, culinary event or a community get-together, we can create a mobile app that will engage your attendees and add a little more fun!\n\nTodd Rogers and Rick Solner started CrowdTorch in 2009 because they loved attending festivals and wanted to find a way they could attend more. This passion is what drives the development of our apps, and we always want to build apps that attendees love as much as the festival organizer! CrowdTorch has built apps for ESPN's X Games, the Kentucky Derby, the National Cherry Blossom Festival, and Toyota's Auto Show, to name a few. Its mobile apps have been downloaded by over two million users, average a 4.5 star rating across mobile platforms, and have consistently increased attendee participation and sponsor interest at hundreds of high-profile events.\nCrowdTorch recently joined Cventâ€”the leading provider of cloud-based event management solutions and mobile applications for event organizers around the world.
