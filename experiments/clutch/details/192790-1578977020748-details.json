Freelancers offer their services on a first-come, first-serve basis for rates ranging from $5 to $50 per hour. \nOn the backend, FreeeUp is insurance against turnover. In the rare case that a freelancer ever leaves the FreeeUp platform, FreeeUp will replace them immediately and cover any replacement costs that the business incurs. \nThe platform was founded by Nathan Hirsch and Connor Gillivan, a duo that has sold over $25 million on Amazon.com and who have hired hundreds of remote freelancers. Both founders can be found on leading business podcasts sharing valuable information about hiring, building remote teams, and best practices in eCommerce. \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"< $25 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2015","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"2628 Passamonte Dr,","locality":"Winter Park","region":"FL","postal_code":"32792","country":"United States","phone":""},{"headquarters":false,"address":"","locality":"","region":"","postal_code":"","country":"United States","phone":""},{"headquarters":false,"address":"","locality":"","region":"","postal_code":"","country":"Philippines","phone":""}]}
