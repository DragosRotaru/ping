This “design thinking” concept means that no product—a print piece, a website, a mobile app, a software application—begins without us thinking about the end user first and working backwards from there. In a design approach, we begin with the question “What will thrill this specific person that we created this product for so much that they will tell everyone about it?”\nSpecto Design designs and develops websites, web applications, and custom web-based software solutions. We specialize in projects that require high security, high availability and high scalability in industries such as financial services and insurance, hospitality, sports, biotech, medical research and health.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2001","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"620 Moulton Ave","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","postal_code":"90031","country":"United States","phone":"818.254.8520"}]}
