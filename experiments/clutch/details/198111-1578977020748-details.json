Additionally, LISI counsels clients on strategic digital marketing initiatives and implements email marketing and social media campaigns. In 1998, practicing lawyer Jason P.\nLisi recognized that law firms needed internet marketing guidance from people with a knowledge of the business of law, so he founded LISI. It is now one of the oldest legal-profession-focused website development companies and one of the nation’s most-experienced law-oriented internet companies, having served hundreds of law firms and thousands of attorneys. LISI puts that experience and intelligence into every website, marketing campaign, and advisory session; LISI websites are carefully planned, beautifully designed, and can be operated almost entirely by a law firm’s internal team without specialized knowledge of technology. LISI is headquartered in Philadelphia and has clients across the United States. Its founder and employees frequently write for local and national publications and speak at legal-marketing seminars, such as those put on by the Legal Marketing Association and bar associations.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"1999","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1500 Walnut Street Suite 1500","locality":"Philadelphia","region":"PA","postal_code":"19102","country":"United States","phone":"215.523.8580"}]}
