To accomplish these goals we must continually reimagine how we increase the value of what we offer our clients while at the same time making our employees even more valuable by investing in their personal and professional growth.\n\nOur primary focus since we started the company in 2002 has been the Microsoft Dynamics suite of products including Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Microsoft Dynamics AX, Microsoft Dynamics CRM and supporting solutions and technologies.\nWithin the context of delivering Microsoft Dynamics solutions we have sought to differentiate what we do and how we do it. One simple principle has probably guided us more than any other and that is simply we must honor existing commitments before we make new ones. The simple maxim of honoring existing commitments first has transformed almost everything we do including how we recruit, hire, staff, and sell projects.\nWe also strive to be a Kaizen organization that is constantly seeking ways to improve. For several years we have been pioneering the use of agile and adaptive methodologies in the delivery of Microsoft Dynamics projects. We are also continually adding more management consulting services into our traditional Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and technology consulting services.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2002","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1735 North Brown Road Suite 425","locality":"Lawrenceville","region":"GA","postal_code":"30043","country":"United States","phone":"+1.866.343.4517"}]}
