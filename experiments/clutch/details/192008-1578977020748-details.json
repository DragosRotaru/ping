One that could quickly respond to our client’s requests. Where there were as few layers as possible between the client and the agency. Oh — and one other key ingredient — a team who would be willing to walk in our clients’ shoes; ride their trucks; stand behind their teller lines. Why? It’s the only way to really become a partner. Together we create successful advertising.","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2000","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"The Bourse, Suite 920, 111 S.
