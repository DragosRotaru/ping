As a full-service firm, Swenson He brings ideas from conception to completion – projects that are otherwise impossible internally or with 3rd party developers accustomed to routine designs.\nOur key to success is based in our engineering team, which fields some of the most talented young developers in the world, with experience and degrees from top technology companies and academies. Every project we undertake is staffed by a dedicated, vertically integrated, in-house team that is specialized to meet the unique demands of each endeavor. \nSwenson He engineers tackle every step in the build as an individual problem, with a sheer focus on intelligent design, precision & efficiency. As a firm, we have institutionalized a ‘final 1%’ method – with every step, our engineers ask themselves what more they can do to ensure a superior result, contributing to our commitment to a best-in-class level of quality and sophistication.\nUltimately, we are driven by the philosophy that strong mobile technology changes lives in meaningful ways, and it is our goal that each one of our projects advances this cause. We are dedicated to constantly pushing the cutting edge forward, always questioning the limits of what an app can achieve.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$25,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2014","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"407 N Maple Drive, Ground 1","locality":"Beverly Hills","region":"CA","postal_code":"90210","country":"United States","phone":"4244652525"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"17250 Dallas Pkwy","locality":"Dallas","region":"TX","postal_code":"75248","country":"United States","phone":""}]}
