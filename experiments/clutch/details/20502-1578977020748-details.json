Based in Boston and with clients across the U.S., we're behind some of the most influential digital platforms and strategies out there, ones that changed how people communicate and shaped their world.\n\nAt Alipes, we prefer telescopes to safety goggles—but we use both. We’re constantly asking why, thinking forward, and looking around corners for what’s out there. And if it doesn’t exist, we figure out how to build it.\nWe believe the work is the hero. We take pride in delivering the best solutions to help clients meet their business goals, not the awards those solutions garner (although the awards are nice, too). We do everything in-house, from content to code, so we’re not just strategy-makers, We’re the execution platform that delivers measurable results for every client.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2003","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"28 Atlantic Ave. #131","locality":"Boston","region":"MA","postal_code":"02110","country":"United States","phone":"+1.617.303.1045"}]}
