But, we tend to focus on WHY we do what we do. Our purpose is four simple words: Business First. Online Second.\nWe believe in understanding your business model, strategy, industry, and processes - BEFORE making any online recommendations. Sure, we could suggest you build a flashy website, send out monthly email campaigns, build an ecommerce site to sell merchandise online, or start blogging to increase your brand recognition. But, is that going to impact your bottom line or efficiency? Does it make sense? Until we can answer these questions, we won't suggest a thing.\nPut briefly, we provide ecommerce, online marketing, and website design and development, all with a focus on user experience. We've been doing so for nine years with 20 Titans reinforcing our \"Business First. Online Second\" mantra.Â \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2004","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"7400 Metro Blvd, Suite 190","locality":"Minneapolis","region":"MN","postal_code":"55439","country":"United States","phone":"612.200.1015"}]}
