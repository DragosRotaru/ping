Our culture is one of the underdog.  We embrace our flexibility and nimbleness (if that's even a word) and use it to our client's advantage. At VWA our goal each and everyday is to find new and innovative ways to make every marketing dollar work that much harder, by creating work that's smarter. Because at the end of the day, our goal is not to outspend the competition. It's to outsmart them.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"1984","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"3384 Peachtree Road Suite 200,","locality":"Atlanta","region":"GA","postal_code":"30326","country":"United States","phone":"404.355.0126"}]}
