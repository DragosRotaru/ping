They've learned that trying to 'do-it-yourself' to hopefully save a little bit of money in the short run usually leaves them with a less-than-professional result and ends up costing a lot more in missed opportunities in the long run.\nWe take care of everything - website design, hosting, domain names, email accounts, web marketing, updates, and a bunch of other things you probably haven't even heard of! The service also offers great tools and learning resources for our customers if they do want to make updates and changes to their website themselves, and to see exactly how well their website is doing on search engines.\nWe have been helping small businesses all across Canada since 1999 from our head office in Winnipeg, and we have satellite reps in Vancouver, Calgary, and Montreal.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$25 - $49 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"1999","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"300-245 McDermot Ave","locality":"Winnipeg","region":"MB","postal_code":"R3B 0S6","country":"Canada","phone":"1-877-517-7867"}]}
