As seasoned entrepreneurs, we are major advocates of the “Lean Startup” movement popularized by Eric Reis. The idea is simple: build a “minimum viable product” so simple that you can release a first version and gather user feedback before building a single superfluous feature. In other words, launch today, validate tomorrow, and adapt quickly.\nWe help you bring ideas to life by following a 5 Step Process that is described at http://leanometry.com/process.. Check our work at http://leanometry.com/work, and if you want us to help you contact us at hello@leanometry.com or 888.228.1090.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2013","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"820 Broadways St, Suite 126","locality":"Santa Monica","region":"CA","postal_code":"90401","country":"United States","phone":"888.228.1090"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"820 Broadways St, Suite 126","locality":"Santa Monica","region":"CA","postal_code":"90401","country":"United States","phone":"888.228.1090"}]}
