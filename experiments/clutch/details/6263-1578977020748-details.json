A website is more than a poster or billboard for a company or organization. Itâ€™s your face, your personality, and your voice in the interactive world. We make things work efficiently both internally and externally and develop systems that increase your level of productivity and make everyday tasks that much easier to manage.\nThe Nine has a strong background in developing content management systems, e-commerce solutions and social media integration. Each one of our systems is unique to our client and programmed from scratch. Our development languages are JavaScript, mySQL/PHP, Flash and CSS. Over the past nine years we have developed a strong system for taking care of our clients. You will be guided through the phases one by one, from the initial contract signing to the final product being launched, including site maintenance and hosting. You will be assigned a client relationship manager that will be your personal web assistant to answer any questions, help gather content, and ensure that your project is priority. Small is better. The Nine prides itself on being a hands-on interactive agency. Your project will have the attention of not only the design and program team, but the upper levels of management as well, from the President to the Creative Director and Systems Director. Our goal is to make sure you are taken care of each step of the way and your project is top priority.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2001","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"2207 7th Street","locality":"Tuscaloosa","region":"AL","postal_code":"35401","country":"United States","phone":"205.561.6691"}]}
