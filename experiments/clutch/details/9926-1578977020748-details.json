My mother pointed out that there was ‘Graphic Layout And Design’ within GLAD as well. The rest – as they say – is history.” Gina founded GLAD WORKS in 1995, specializing initially in logo design, corporate identity and capabilities brochures.\nIn 1999, IT Director Adam Harvey’s arrival helped fuse technology with design, in order to help meet client's growing online demands. As the firm evolved, we added copywriting, visual media, PR and client management to round out our one-stop-shop approach.\nThat fusion is still the foundation for what makes us unique. GLAD WORKS continues to win nationally renowned clients and a reputation for offering unparalleled design, marketing savvy and innovative tech programs. Our overall work approach gives us a critical insight into a brand's customers, business, and market. We provide opportunities to increase client's return on investment, enhance productivity, and maximize the value of their relationships with customers, employees, and partners.\nDon't just take our word for it though. Work with us and find out what makes us different! \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"1995","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"545 Pawtucket Avenue design studio c208","locality":"Pawtucket","region":"RI","postal_code":"02860","country":"United States","phone":"401.724.4523"}]}
