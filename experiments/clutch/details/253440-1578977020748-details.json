We are based in New Orleans and have additional offices in Baton Rouge and Monroe, La.  By structure and philosophy, we are a full-service agency. At Peter Mayer we believe every brand possesses capital – financial, human, intellectual and, most important, cultural.\nLeveraging a brand’s cultural capital can create powerful and emotional connections that defy competition, price, and even convenience. Peter Mayer was born and grew from a place steeped in culture – New Orleans. Our connection to the culture of our hometown is the foundation of our creativity and it defines the agency. So it is only natural that we see the enormous potential of culture as a way to create lasting relationships. Simply put, culture matters. We have received many national, regional and local awards – not just for our exceptional creative work, but for producing work that produces results. We are especially proud of our three national Gold EFFIE Awards, which recognize advertising campaigns that demonstrate superior measurable results. We are also very proud to be consistently named as “One of the best places to work in New Orleans” by New Orleans CityBusiness.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"1967","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"318 Camp Street,","locality":"New Orleans","region":"LA","postal_code":"70130","country":"United States","phone":"+1.504.581.7191"}]}
