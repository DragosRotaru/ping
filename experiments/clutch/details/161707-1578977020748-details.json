We create strategies and content that earn attention for our clients'â€‹ brands at scale.\nWe believe that the best content works hard because it gets talked about, and that the best way to get talked about is to do something different: surprise people, innovate or be first.\nTo do that, we bring together a unique blend of skills, melding together talent from the entertainment industry, digital and social media, advertising and marketing, commercial broadcasting and large-scale logistical production.\nThat mix of expertise means that we really understand brand challenges and the consumer landscape. It means we give our clients great strategic thinking and creative ideas, and that we love getting our hands dirty and making things on everything from a micro to a global scale.\nWhat we make can range from a global social media programme, to a live TV broadcast, to a branded content partnership or a six-month experiential programme across four continents.\nWe're also small, lean and fat-free, so we do it much more quickly, efficiently and cost-effectively than an agency.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2009","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"15-16 Margaret St","locality":"London","region":"LND","postal_code":"W1W 8RW","country":"United Kingdom","phone":"+44.203.327.2680"}]}
