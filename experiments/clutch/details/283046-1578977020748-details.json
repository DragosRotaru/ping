While many projects began in the pursuit of getting “results”, we soon found that clients would be left feeling unsatisfied once short-term “success” was met. Traditionally marketing agencies have offered ‘results’ but struggle to offer ‘consistency’; leaving clients unable to invest, or build.\nThis is why we have built Atrium to be a Digital Marketing Agency aimed at providing consistent business results through a Systems Engineering approach to marketing platforms & routines. Our team applies systems engineering principles to define optimal platforms and routines needed, as well as the latest technologies and information, to achieve marketing performance consistently.\n780-438-5766\ncontact@atriumdigital.com\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2000","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"10250–82 Street","locality":"Edmonton","region":"AB","postal_code":"T6A 3M3","country":"Canada","phone":"7804385766"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"Suite 8102, 375 Water Street","locality":"Vancouver","region":"BC","postal_code":"V6B 0M9","country":"Canada","phone":"6045595766"}]}
