We help our clients understand their audiences, capture their attention through creative work, and turn readers into growth opportunities.\nWe’ve built our company on the foundation of the skills gained through creative writing education. We’re uniquely positioned to write in voices that aren’t our own, about subjects we haven’t yet explored, and with the skill to drive readers to understand, feel, and value exactly what our clients intend. Our clients, then, gain an entire team of empowered and supported creative writers to help them create consistent, genuine, and effective content.\nImportantly, it is our philosophy that writers are most successful when working closely with other writers on a team. In such an environment, writers support one another, they sharpen against each other, and they produce stronger, more consistent, and more prolific work. For this reason, we do not hire freelance writers or contract our work out to the lowest bidder. All of our writers work full-time out of our office in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nCreative writers telling your story, helping you grow. That’s Metonymy Media.\nB2B Content: Voice & Messaging, Content Strategies, Blogs, White Papers, eBooks, Ghostwritten Bylines, Video Scripts, Interactive Storyboarding\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2011","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"1052 Virginia Avenue","locality":"Indianapolis","region":"IN","postal_code":"46203","country":"United States","phone":"317.731.2025"}]}
