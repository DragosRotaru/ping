Dude, where’s my car…?\nAt Conkurent, we understand that not all industries are created equal, and development initiatives can’t be conceived with a template. Over the years we’ve worked hard to perfect an approach known as Agile Methodology, which has allowed us to not only deliver an effective product, catered to the needs of a given company, but also to build long lasting strategic relationships.\nWhat is Agile Methodology? Simply put, it’s a frame of mind centered in adapting to change, as opposed to attempting to predict everything from the start. Of course, this doesn’t mean we don’t plan intensively. We thoroughly research your industry and familiarize ourselves with the intricacies of your business objectives. This gives us the best possible starting point from which to sculpt and craft a digital solution that’s as flexible as you are.\nFrom there, our process is cyclical:\nWe study and plan.\nWe design and develop.\nWe test and deploy.\nWe learn and, as our programming forefathers might have said in days of olde,… GO TO 1\nFrom this simple, streamlined iteration process, we are able to test, learn, evaluate, and adapt. The result is a ‘living, breathing’ product that is constantly improving, continually providing valuable feedback, and consistently manifesting in the form of tangible, real world results. Because at the end of the day, the numbers are what matter. And when you forge a relationship with Conkurent, you’re gaining an ally who understands this; and a partner who specializes in converting the abstract into the concrete.\nAnd when the iteration cycles, the data, and the communication are all flowing harmoniously, your end product will be a thing of beauty.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"Undisclosed","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2001","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"Gogolya 124/44","locality":"Zaporizhzhya","region":"DO","postal_code":"60074","country":"Ukraine","phone":"+1 (224) 548-8594"}]}
