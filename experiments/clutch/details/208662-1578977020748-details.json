But it's hard to know what to call ourselves these days. An advertising agency, a digital marketing agency, a creative branding agency? Heck, what we do is pretty simple: create integrated advertising campaigns that sell your product and get awareness for your brand. That’s why you hire an ad agency or marketing agency, right?\nYou want people talking about you, clicking on your digital accoutrements and passing your content around on social media. To make that all happen, we work in close collaboration with our clients to determine goals before we start, so we’re sure to achieve those goals when we’re finished. We’ve had the pleasure of working with some pretty amazing brands like Roku, Dropbox, Nike, Ford, San Jose Sharks, SFMOMA, Opendoor and Kelly Services. We closely track results for all our campaigns so if you'd like to see some detailed case studies, please reach out. We also offer brand consulting services for startups and smaller companies not quite ready for a full-on campaign. We can help with brand strategy, brand voice and all the basic brand assets and content to lay a solid foundation. To see more of what we do, visit DivisionofLabor.com or contact us for a free phone consultation. \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$25,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2010","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"328 Pine Street","locality":"Sausalito","region":"CA","postal_code":"94965","country":"United States","phone":"4159448185"}]}
