This is simply because we already have more than a decade of experience building web applications with them. We still think that Django is the best Web framework and we use it daily, but mostly for developing RESTful APIs for mobile apps and single-page JavaScript applications.\nHere at Monmar we're using React and AngularJS extensively. React seems to have a brighter future so we are retiring from Angular and focusing on React with ES6. But, we still can help you with your AngularJS and/or CoffeeScript challenges.\nWe discovered Meteor a couple of years ago and have been using it since then. It has great potential to grow into a standard platform for modern JavaScript applications. Monmar is a registered Meteor Partner.\nMonmar develops native iOS, watchOS and OS X application with Swift.\nAs a team of modern full-stack developers we have many years experience with DevOps tasks, performance and scaling problem solving.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2007","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"Musninky g. 22-39","locality":"Vilnius","region":"","postal_code":"LT-07182","country":"Lithuania","phone":""}]}
