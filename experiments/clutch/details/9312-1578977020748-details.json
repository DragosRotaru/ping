This structure was set up to enable an international group to form.\nTVH Consulting is organized like major audit consultancies, i.e. with partners and shareholder employees sharing the same values and ambitions. These are specified in a charter to which they must first fully agree.\n\nThe ambition of TVH SA in mid-term is to become a major international player in software development and information system installation. As a result, TVH Consulting has implemented a rigorous and innovative organizational structure from its inception to offer every employee who demonstrates his/her managerial or creative qualities the prospect of becoming a full partner and thus actively participate in defining the group’s strategy.\nPartner status is not only reached after a number of years spent in the company, it is also linked with the need to obtain convincing results (customer satisfaction, ability to lead, creativity, commitment) consistently acquired over time. Salaries can vary with the company’s results, and a sizeable portion of bonuses is re-invested alongside a significant initial capital investment. Cooptation is subject to the approval of 90% of the College of Partners and requires unreserved compliance with the Charter of Founding Partners.\nIn the short and mid-term, TVH SA foresees acquisitions which are fully in line with the group’s strategy.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2003","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"22 rue Guynemer","locality":"Maisons lafitte","region":"","postal_code":"78601","country":"France","phone":"33 (0)1 34 93 17 27"}]}
