Founded in 2009, and led by seasoned business and technology executives, we help our clients “Mobilize Their Business” by creating award-winning native mobile applications for the iOS and Android platforms.\nUtilizing our mobile-optimized methodology, we partner with entrepreneurs and early stage startups to launch their mobile-enabled business, and we work with established corporations to build mobile products that support their digital transformation.\nIt all began when we started building iPhone apps for fun, and a few of them became big hits. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we quit our day jobs and began making apps for other organizations like Pearl Jam and Kodak. After working in the trenches for a while we realized that building a great mobile app could be expensive, time consuming, and complex. So we set out on our journey to make building mobile apps easier.\nThat’s why we started Red Foundry – to take our years of experience in building successful mobile apps and package it into a team of engineers armed with technology and process methodology to lower the cost, complexity, and delivery risk of building killer mobile apps.\nRed Foundry was built on these simple principles:\nAll apps should be beautiful, unique, intuitive, and relevant. \nAny company, large or small, should have the opportunity to leverage the benefits of mobile app technology. \nAn app is useless without a team of skilled people to support and evolve it. \nEvery day Red Foundry tackles the tough challenges that face most businesses when going mobile. But most importantly Red Foundry apps are built by a team of software engineers who are passionate about mobile.  It's all we do.  And we love it.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$25,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2009","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"400 W.
