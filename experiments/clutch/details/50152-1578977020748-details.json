We are passionate about creating solutions that add value to your business and connect consumer with your brand.\nWe are creatives, we are technologist, we are thinkers, we are problem solvers, we are a full service digital agency that takes projects from concept to launch. We are small, agile and responsive to the unique requirements of our clients and their projects. We are driven by delivering compelling experiences across a wide spectrum of digital platforms.\nThe creation of FortyFour was born out of the frustration we’ve experienced working within less than optimal systems filled with egos and the desire to grow bank accounts. The prospect of creating an agency that was personal, honest, ethical, and ultimately driven by our decisions for what is best for our team and clients, was something we couldn’t pass up. Born late in 2011 our values remain the same, yet we continue to set new goals as we develop and evolve.\nOur approach is driven from a carefully considered process. We examine the full spectrum of your business and the industry. We drill down to the core of what defines your products and services. We want to know the simple truth. From concept to delivery we ensure that your brand communicates the right message. Contact us and let’s talk about how we might be able to work together.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2011","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"331 Elizabeth St. Suite A","locality":"Atlanta","region":"GA","postal_code":"30307","country":"United States","phone":"404.729.0702"}]}
