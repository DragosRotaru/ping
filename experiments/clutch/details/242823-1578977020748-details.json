In fact, we’re a little bit scrappy. But for our purposes here, let’s go with lean and dynamic.

We work hard, we play hard, and company culture means everything to us.","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2006","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"2033 N.
