Our primary focus is English and Japanese mobile-first web design and e-commerce solutions. Our team translates ideas into information design strategies for global companies and product brands. We work in close cooperation with our clients and partners, even if they are on the other side of the world.\nAs a top rated WordPress web design team we know our work has to do more than just look good on a mobile device. More importantly, it has to provide an elegant solution for clearly communicating information. Mobile-first WordPress web design is a way to build information strategies that reach across cultural and geographical boundaries. This is how we connect startups and product brands to their global audience and provide a better mobile user experience.\nWe employ a simple process because that works best. Our multilingual WordPress web design team focuses on doing more with less. Our designers have over 15 years years of WordPress web design experience. We strive to get right to the heart of unique problems. Our solutions appear simple from the outside but have a lot of research and thought behind them. This allows us to deliver innovative mobile-first web design solutions in less time, and for less money.\nWe believe that remote work is the best solution for both ourselves and our clients. The digital age has made business simpler in the sense that by leveraging the latest technologies costs can be cut but quality doesnâ€™t need to suffer. We like to have our clients work with us, have a say, and to be a part of the process. Working as a remote multilingual web design team has taught us over the years how to most effectively allocate our time and streamline our workflow so that we can all get stuff done.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$50 - $99 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2004","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"AXiS - 502 6-6 Umedamachi, Aoba-ku","locality":"Sendai","region":"04","postal_code":"980-0005","country":"Japan","phone":"+81 090 6629 1125"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"6-19-13 Shinbashi Minato-Ku","locality":"Tokyo, Japan","region":"","postal_code":"105-0004","country":"Japan","phone":""},{"headquarters":false,"address":"Via Copernico 38","locality":"Milan, Italy","region":"","postal_code":"20125","country":"Italy","phone":""},{"headquarters":false,"address":"815 1st Ave","locality":"Seattle","region":"WA","postal_code":"98104","country":"United States","phone":""}]}
