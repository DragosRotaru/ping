But we think of ourselves as marketers with great stories to tell. We are positively obsessed with our clients and make it our business to uncover what’s unique about their business. Give us the most complicated product or service offering and we’ll make it easy for anyone to understand, embrace and, most of all, trust. Who we are is really what we do — we make the complex simple. And the simple, very, very powerful.\nCombining breathtaking design, compelling narrative and cutting-edge technology, we use every tool in our arsenal to illuminate what makes our clients’ products special. We connect brands with the right customers, across a rich and varied landscape of media. We believe in extending the “big idea” beyond traditional media by creating robust digital platforms that connect both on-line and off-line marketing to consumers at the most poignant times and in the most interesting ways. We believe that extraordinary marketing can be both a discipline and an art form. The art is in doing it well. The discipline is in doing it right. We are Designory.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"250 - 999","founded":"1970","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"211 East Ocean Blvd. Suite 100 , CA","locality":"Long Beach","region":"CA","postal_code":"90802","country":"United States","phone":"1.562.624.0200"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"","locality":"Los Angeles","region":"CA","postal_code":"90001","country":"United States","phone":""}]}
