We are an independent, passionate, agile, hungry, fully-accredited IPA agency of 25 people, that punches well beyond its weight – this year we are ranked #28 in Campaign’s Top 100. We are lucky to be making UK and global work with some brilliantly disruptive and progressive companies, and actively seek to work with brands who share our drive, openness to new ideas, and who have a reason to fight for their place in the market.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$100,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2012","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"87 Weston Street","locality":"London","region":"LND","postal_code":"SE1 3RS","country":"United Kingdom","phone":"207.287.2552"}]}
