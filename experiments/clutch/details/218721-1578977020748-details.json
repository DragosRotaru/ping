Do you need SEO? PPC? Social Media? It may seem easier to just forget the whole thing and grab a cold fizzy drink. At Digital Caffeine we can map out a clear strategy that makes most sense for your company and explain it in plain English - no need to Google all the acronyms.\nWe provide strategic online marketing services to improve your search engine rankings (SEO), paid search (PPC) and evaluate how well your current campaigns are performing (see more in services). We believe in: 1. Explaining everything so that even your technophobe Aunt Mavis can understand it. 2. Recommending simple solutions first. No need for a pricey phone app when just making your landing page mobile friendly will accomplish your same goal. 3. Measuring and testing. How do you know if you’re improving if you don’t know where you started? And how do you know what’s working if you don’t test? That’s why we’re always doing both. Ready to give your marketing a buzz?\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$50 - $99 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"2012","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"915 S.
