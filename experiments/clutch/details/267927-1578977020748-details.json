We have a complete in-house team and pride ourselves off of not mysteriously out-sourcing anything. We have been in business for well over a decade and we fully believe that every good client relationship starts with transparent communication.\nWe have spent thousands of hours educating ourselves, over the 10 years we have been in business, on Google's consistently changing algorithm to be able to know exactly what to do to get the ROI clients are looking for. Digital Marketing is best learned through trial and error with multiple different situations and industries. We have perfected our craft to be able to streamline our knowledge into your marketing.\nWe get you results\nWe offer outstanding customer service\nOur reviews are great\nWe have decades of experience\nWe boast industry-relevant awards\nWe rank ourselves #1 in Southern California for our industry (SEO), locally and organically.\nWe take on far fewer clients than we get wanting to work with us. Why? Because if your website has been penalized, you aren’t in an industry that is favorable for SEO or your expectations are unreasonably high, we aren’t the right fit for you. As a company, we will not work on projects we aren’t fully confident will succeed.\nIf your business is not the right fit for us, we will point you in the best direction possible.\nWe base our clientele on quality rather than quantity. We don’t want a high-volume client base. More clients means hiring more employees, which means less bottom-line for us. We would rather have you be able to talk to the owners and not a sales rep.\nWe do not outsource anything; all work is done in-house by One Click Marketing employees that cater to you and your business.\nThank you and Call Us :)\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$50 - $99 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2009","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"501 West Broadway","locality":"San Diego","region":"CA","postal_code":"92101","country":"United States","phone":"619.361.7446"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"11440 W Bernardo Ct #300","locality":"San Diego","region":"CA","postal_code":"92127","country":"United States","phone":""},{"headquarters":false,"address":"","locality":"","region":"","postal_code":"","country":"Serbia","phone":""}]}
