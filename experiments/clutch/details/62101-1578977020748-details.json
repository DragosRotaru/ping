Josh stands for enthusiasm & passion. We are driven by Josh & we believe Programming is an Art.\nApart from building and curating its own team, we undertake various initiatives in contributing back to the Ruby open source community.

The idea was named CodeCuriosity.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$25 - $49 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2007","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"Mahalunge Baner Road","locality":"Pune","region":"MH","postal_code":"411 045","country":"India","phone":"+91.20.65313161"}]}
