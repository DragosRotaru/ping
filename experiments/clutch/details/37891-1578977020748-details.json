Our results-proven mix of cross-channel marketing, audience-centric creative, and data-backed strategies focused on engagement will present new opportunities well beyond the traditional days of impressions-driven programmatic and mass media buys.\nHOW WE WORK\nMost firms are virtual factories, where managers juggle dozens of accounts every day. This is a lose-lose situation. You're not happy in the end, and we don't have a relationship we're proud to stand by.\nEach strategist is assigned a small handful of our account load, becoming an expert in every aspect of your business, and market movements. The work we do is labor-intensive, communication-intensive, and incredibly dynamic. Overloading our teams would make success impossible.\nPreserving this service model requires us to be pragmatic in choosing client partners. We will objectively analyze your business, goals, and budget well before we negotiate terms. If we determine we can’t bring value to your or our methodology isn’t a good fit, we'll be honest. Consequently, should you choose us as your digital partner, you can be confident in our ability to deliver the results we promise. \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$5,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2011","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"641 S St NW","locality":"Washington","region":"DC","postal_code":"20001","country":"United States","phone":"646.770.3271"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"175 Varick St","locality":"New York","region":"NY","postal_code":"10014","country":"United States","phone":"646.770.3271"}]}
