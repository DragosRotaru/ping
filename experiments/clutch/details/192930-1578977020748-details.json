Our service caters to businesses requiring skilled, part-time help throughout the workday.\nWe offer a range of services intended to \"fill the cracks\" and expand the resources available to our customers, so that they can grow their business faster, for less. By working with LongerDays, clients have full-time access to help. Our staff is available from 9:00am to 5:30pm EST, Monday through Friday, just like a traditional employee. Our clients, however, only pay for services when they need to engage them. This built in scalability eliminates the downtime associated with traditional employees, helping our clients grow their business without incurring unnecessary payroll costs. The cost of our service is comparable to that of a traditional part-time employee. This value proposition is attractive to business owners regardless of the state of the economy, which has enabled us to grow rapidly despite the poor economic climate.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"< $25 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2010","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"360 W.
