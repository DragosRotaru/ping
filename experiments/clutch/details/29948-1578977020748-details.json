Our mission is to bridge the gap between businesses and offshore developers. We manage small-medium sized IT projects to make sure businesses get the quality product they need at a price they can stomach.\nCOMMUNICATION IS KEY \nWorried about language (or culture) barriers? We know a breakdown in communication can stop a project dead in its tracks. That’s why we have native English, German and Ukrainian speaking staff who understand the language, and the culture.\nCUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY \nWe use the right technology to get the job done, mixing old workhorse tech with the best of what’s new. In the end, you get the perfect mix of usability and innovation to keep you running for years to come.\nIT’S THE QUALITY, STUPID\nOther guys over-promise and under-deliver. We don’t want you to settle for less than you deserve. We deliver a polished product that you can be proud to show off and use.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$25,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$25 - $49 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2011","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"Hinterbergstrasse 24","locality":"Steinhausen","region":"","postal_code":"6312","country":"Switzerland","phone":"+410555520250"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"Opryshkivska 3 str.","locality":"Lviv","region":"","postal_code":"79000","country":"Ukraine","phone":"+410555520250"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"Zylanska 72","locality":"Kyiv","region":"","postal_code":"","country":"Ukraine","phone":""}]}
