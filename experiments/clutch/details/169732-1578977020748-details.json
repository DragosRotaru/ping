In the eight years since our Austin advertising firm was founded, we've grown into one of Austin's best marketing and consulting firms - and we've done it without giving up on the risk-taking attitude that we started with.\nRock Candy Media is your creative salesforce. Our campaigns combine a creativity that can't be taught with a business-savvy that can only be learned the hard way. We give your company a voice of its own, and that distinction could mean the difference between being a contender and a somebody. A cohesive user-based marketing experience can enhance every marketing effort you make and give your salespeople the right umbrella to flourish under. Everything we do is predicated on setting you up for long-term growth and creating new sales opportunities.\nRock Candy Media is the anti-template. Everything we doâ€”from design to messaging to development - is grounded in long-term marketing strategy. We challenge our clients to let us make them uncomfortable. We identify and pursue partnerships and sales funnels you've never even thought of. Our marketing consultants approach your business like it's our business. We're a full service advertising agency. Our team handles every aspect of marketing your business - messaging, branding, public relations, copywriting, web design, web development, social media management, organic search and paid ads.
