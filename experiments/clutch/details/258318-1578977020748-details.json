We have aprons. Ok, so we're a bit quirky. We have a passion for exceptional service, original thinking - and food. So we decided to combine our passions into a new kind of venue: a restaurant-like setting, where we serve fresh ideas daily and free lunch once a week for our clients. We also have special dinners and wine tastings. Basically, we just want to conduct business in a warm and friendly atmosphere that's conducive to creative thinking.","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"2 - 9","founded":"1978","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"3707 Butler Street","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"PA","postal_code":"15201","country":"United States","phone":"+1.412.586.5840"}]}
