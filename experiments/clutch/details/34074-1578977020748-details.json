I drew and sold my first logo at age twelve and I'm still at it. Along the way I've been lucky enough to help create a few of mobiles earliest successes for companies like Alaska Airlines, AllRecipes, Target, TOMS and CNN. In recent years I've helped several startups such as AutoLotto, Spoon Rocket, Trizic and Blush design successful products and raise millions in funding.","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"Undisclosed","num_employees":"Freelancer","founded":"2012","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"","locality":"San Francisco","region":"CA","postal_code":"","country":"United States","phone":""}]}
