During the last 25+ years, we’ve worked with a wide range of customers including small and large distributors, manufacturers, healthcare facilities, regional restaurant chains, and more.\nSome of these customers had a few million in sales when we started working with them, some had over one billion. Regardless of the company size or scope of the project, our passion and commitment is always focused on delivering the right business system to our customers and making certain their expectations are met.\nWe fully understand that selecting and adopting a new software system to run your business is a major undertaking. Finding a partner to provide guidance and support is often the key to successfully choosing and implementing any ERP solution. We believe that who you work with is just as important as the software you purchase, which is why we never recommend or install software unless we are 100% sure it’s the right choice for the customer.\nPlease contact us, or visit our website www.em-powered.com to learn more about us and to view some of our customer stories.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$25,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"1989","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"3900 Industrial Park Dr.","locality":"Altoona","region":"PA","postal_code":"16602","country":"United States","phone":"814-942-8777"}]}
