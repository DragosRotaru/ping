Since our foundation in 2004, we’ve partnered with some of the world's leading brands and have grown to studios around the world in New York, Malmö, London, Sydney, Tokyo and Lisbon.\nWe champion unrivalled user experience design and best-in-class technical practices, but we recognise that product is so much more than either of these in isolation. For us, the magic happens when these elements come together to form a product that is centred around real human needs. And when it comes to quality, we literally wrote the book on how to deliver Pixel Perfect Precision.\nOur cultural values are centred around enabling the ambitions of 250+ inspiring and talented individuals so that together we can make a difference to the world. We value collaboration, fun, craft, openness and authenticity, and work as ‘one team’ with our clients.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$50,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$150 - $199 / hr","num_employees":"50 - 249","founded":"2004","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"118 Commonwealth St, Surry Hills","locality":"Sydney","region":"NSW","postal_code":"2010","country":"Australia","phone":"+61.02.8188.3900"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"62 Shoreditch High St","locality":"London","region":"","postal_code":"E1 6JJ","country":"United Kingdom","phone":"+44.20.3222.0960"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"26 Broadway, 16th Floor","locality":"New York","region":"NY","postal_code":"1000","country":"United States","phone":"+1.212.518.4900"},{"headquarters":false,"address":"Kärleksgatan 2","locality":"Malmö","region":"","postal_code":"","country":"Sweden","phone":"+46.040.330.480"}]}
