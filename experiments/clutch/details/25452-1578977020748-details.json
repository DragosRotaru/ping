All our team is co-located and works under the same roof. We work faster and better when we are able to directly interact with our colleagues. We work on challenges together and all our team members benefit from the collective knowledge and skill set of the team.\nLocated in Bucharest, Romania. This fact helps us provide better prices to our customers. Another benefit is that in Bucharest there is a very large pool of highly trained  IT experts. We also benefit from the fastest internet in the EU, almost everyone here is proficient in English, we have great IT related universities and many other pro arguments.\nWe are independent. HyperSense is a privately owned company. We are responsible to only one stakeholder and that is our customers. Our owners are directly involved in all aspects of our work, including client relations, software architecture and development.\nTimezone doesn’t matter. In our experience we worked with customers from every corner of the world. We know how to handle the timezone difference in order to make the communication and delivery process smooth and not affected by this. Working with us will feel like having a highly experienced software development department in your own office.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$25,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$25 - $49 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2003","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"5th Orzari street","locality":"Bucharest","region":"B","postal_code":"021551","country":"Romania","phone":"+40 726 848490"}]}
