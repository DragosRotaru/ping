We are the most awarded creative team in the region because we focus on what is important to our clients: smart ideas that get results. Our unique advantages are our size and experience. We are not a traditional ad agency so there are no layers to go through and no big overhead costs to pay for. And we plug in nicely with internal marketing teams and suppliers. If you got any closer than that, you'd have to work here.","min_project_size":"$10,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"$100 - $149 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2003","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"100 First Avenue, Suite 200","locality":"Pittsburgh","region":"PA","postal_code":"15222","country":"United States","phone":"412.33.0123"}]}
