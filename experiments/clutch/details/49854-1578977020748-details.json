Beginning in 1996 we were a group of digital consultants (read: nerds with a vision) focused on the development of high-quality websites, e-commerce platforms, intranets, and creating web-based applications that were the first of their kind. Since then we've come a long way.\n \nWith this highly technical background, we have since had the opportunity to become experts in all things digital marketing and are equipped to take on any digital challenge we are presented with. We have since grown into the robust agency that we are today – providing services across digital marketing, user-centered design, and development to our wide variety of clients. It is our top priority to create long-term relationships and results that have a meaningful impact for our clients, and we have successfully done so time and time again. \nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"Undisclosed","avg_hourly_rate":"Undisclosed","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"1996","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"285 Summer Street, Suite 100","locality":"Boston","region":"MA","postal_code":"02210","country":"United States","phone":""}]}
