We both had local service businesses in the same industry, and we were both missing calls and losing sales. We needed someone to answer the phone, but didn’t want to spend thousands of dollars a month on hiring an in-house receptionist.\nWe decided to create Vicky Virtual Receptionists for the same reason countless other businesses get started – to fill a need. In our case, we wanted to provide a virtual receptionist service with highly trained, enthusiastic, US-based agents, at a fraction of the cost of hiring a full-time, in-house receptionist.\nTeam Vicky continually strives to provide a world-class first impression for your business. Our friendly agents will answer your calls cheerfully, take messages as needed, route calls as instructed and even provide live chat services for people that visit your website!\nMore than a fancy answering service, we will learn your business so that we can represent you as well as in-house staff. You benefit from an assigned team of 4-6 receptionists. We found a sweet spot of agents for someone to always be available, while being a small enough team for each agent to learn your business over time. Our cost-effective, engaged approach will help bridge the gap between a prospect and a long-term client relationship.\nREAD MORE...","min_project_size":"$1,000+","avg_hourly_rate":"< $25 / hr","num_employees":"10 - 49","founded":"2014","locations":[{"headquarters":true,"address":"","locality":"Chicago","region":"IL","postal_code":"","country":"United States","phone":"1.312.756.0308"}]}
